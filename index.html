					<p>My name is Rick Gardner. I have a beautiful wife and four amazing kids.  Some of my loves in life include College football, Learning new things (Coding), Spending time with family, Lake Powell, Snowboarding, running and bike rides with my family.  My main goal for taking this bootcamp is to become amazing at web Development. I've tried to learn coding in the past but never put the time in to be serious about it. my goal by the end of the course is to have the confidence to start my own web marketing company.</p>
